# form-manipulation-js

Not a lot to see here as there was a fair bit of other config needed to use this jQuery. However, it was a way of customising how CMB2 worked to enable a kind of site-builder wiki experience.

It uses CMB2 group field to allow for selection of different layout components, which when selected then, using jQuery shows related content fields.

In the Twig template, the group field is checked and a different partial is output rendering the content differently.
